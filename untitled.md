ROC

To determine the long-term trends that appear on the charts of their favorite stocks, veteran analysts will use a stochastics indicator. My favorite, however, is the momentum indicator called the rate of change (ROC) (which you can read about in Rate of Change):

A rising ROC above zero typically confirms an uptrend while a falling ROC below zero indicates a downtrend.
When the price is consolidating, the ROC will hover near zero. In this case, it is important traders watch the overall price trend since the ROC will provide little insight except for confirming the consolidation.

Chartists pay great attention to the time period in the calculation of ROC. Long-term views of the market or a specific sector or stock, will use perhaps a 26- to 52-week time period for Yx and a shorter view would use 10 days to six months or so.



MA

If the moving average line is angled up, an uptrend is underway. However, moving averages don't make predictions about the future value of a stock; they simply reveal what the price is doing, on average, over a period of time.


Crossovers are another way to utilize moving averages. By plotting a 200-day and 50-day moving average on your chart, a buy signal occurs when the 50-day crosses above the 200-day. A sell signal occurs when the 50-day drops below the 200-day.1﻿ The time frames can be altered to suit your individual trading timeframe.

Moving averages can also provide support or resistance to the price.1﻿ The chart below shows a 100-day moving average acting as support (i.e., the price bounces off of it).
